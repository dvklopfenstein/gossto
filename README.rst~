A Gene Ontology Semantic Similarity Tool
----------------------------------------

Introduction
============

Welcome to GOssTo, the Gene Ontology Semantic Similarity Tool!

GOssTo is a software system for calculating *semantic similarities* between gene products in the Gene Ontology.
GOssTo implements the **Random Walk Contribution**, improving the accuracy of existing similarity measures.

Check Yang's *et al* for a description of the method:

	*Improving GO semantic similarity measures by exploring the ontology beneath the terms and modelling uncertainty*, Bioinformatics, **28** (10), 1383-1389, 2012.

If you use GOssTo, please cite it:

	*GOssTo: an extendable stand-alone and web tool for calculating semantic similarities on the Gene Ontology*, To appear in Bioinformatics.

This is a joint work of the following two labs:

* **PaccanaroLab**: http://www.paccanarolab.org
* **Valentini Lab**: http://homes.di.unimi.it/~valenti/index.html

The official repository for the code is in GitHub: https://github.com/pwac092/gossto

Requirements for compiling GOssTo
=================================

GOssTo is written in Java. You would need *Java 6 or greater* to compile it. Also, you would need the Apache Commons CLI library (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/), which is not included with these sources.

We strongly recommend you using a IDE for developing. A Java project can be easily created with these source files with, for instance, NetBeans.

Getting a binary version
========================

The GitHub repository only provides the source files for GOssTo. If you are looking for a *binary* version (jar file), you will have to go to the official GOssTo webpage, located here: http://www.paccanarolab.org/gossto/. Also, you might be interested in trying GOssTo as a web application called *GOssToWeb* (located here: http://www.paccanarolab.org/gosstoweb).
